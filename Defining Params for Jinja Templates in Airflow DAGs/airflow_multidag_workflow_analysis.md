# Airflow Multi-DAG Workflow Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for building an Airflow plugin that enables users to define a multi-DAG workflow through a UI. The workflow consists of:
1. Transferring files from MinIO to an HPC system
2. Triggering an sbatch command via SSH to run training with the newly added data on the HPC

## Workflow Components

### Component 1: MinIO to HPC File Transfer
- **Source**: MinIO object storage
- **Destination**: HPC file system
- **Trigger**: Manual or scheduled
- **Dependencies**: None (initial DAG)

### Component 2: HPC Training Job
- **Source**: HPC system with transferred data
- **Action**: Run sbatch command via SSH
- **Trigger**: Successful completion of the MinIO to HPC transfer
- **Dependencies**: MinIO to HPC transfer DAG

## Key Considerations
- Authentication for both MinIO and HPC systems
- File path handling and mapping between systems
- Cross-DAG dependencies and triggers
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Parameterization for flexibility
- UI integration for parameter input
